drop. -Animate and record any property of any
component on any GameObject, including particles
and IK - Timeline Scrubbing and Previewing, Play or Edit
Mode, all the same. - Retarget Sequence channel. - Invoke Unity Events in point in time. - Jump to labeled point in time with ease. - Clone, Modify and/or just Reuse Sequence.asset blueprint in any scene in
project with different targets. - AnimatorController or Playable driven.

Logic Forge - Decrease the developing pain by visualizing and
automatizing, avoiding bottlenecks and redundancy,
still not removing full control of code- Functional programming where every
MonoBehaviour is functional component chained by
inputs and outputs creating compact reusable Logic
