              I'm playing central role in the design and architectural development of ISIDORA — an integrated information system for data reporting and analysis — ensuring its scalability, interoperability, and compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks. Building upon this foundation, my future work focuses on the integration of Generative AI systems to further enhance analytical depth, automate insight generation, and support advanced, data-driven decision-making within the financial ecosystem.
NL2SQL Chatbot — System Overview
Designed and implemented a robust, enterprise-grade NL2SQL chatbot in Macedonian, functioning as a full-fledged analytical and reporting platform. Engineered for scalability, security, performance, and maintainability with enterprise-grade standards.
Core Components & Technologies
1. AI / LLM
Built on Microsoft.Extensions.AI and AutoGen.NET, integrating custom LLMs into .NET workflows. Agentic architecture enables SQL, Reporting, and Memory agents to coordinate dynamically via JSON-configurable workflows. Planned drag-and-drop workflow designer for visual orchestration.
2. NL2SQL 
Converts Macedonian natural-language queries into validated SQL. Uses RAG for schema-aware, hallucination-resistant generation grounded in live database schema and metadata.
3. Memory & Personalization
Agentic memory stores user preferences, context, and interaction history, enabling tailored responses and follow-up refinement.
4. Data Storage & Query 
MS SQL Server handles structured data, dynamic schema introspection, and optimized query execution.
5. Web Interface & Reporting
ASP.NET Core MVC generates live dashboards, tables, charts, and AI-driven extremum analyses with human-readable insights.
6. Security & Scalability
RBAC, SQL safety validation, caching, asynchronous agent workflows, connection pooling, and stateless front-end servers enable high performance, horizontal scaling, and secure op.
7. Deployment
Containerized for Azure, with CI/CD  via TFS
